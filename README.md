# Notes for Lab 2
* The hex for the program is automatically loaded into the emulator at runtime,
so you just need to run the emulator, and it will run the program.
* If you wish to look through the 6502 assembler code, I recommend downloading bubbleSort.asm6502,
and opening it in the text editor I made.
* You can find the assembler/text-editor I made for this lab here: https://github.com/eclipse-909/Assembler-6502
# Download and run on your device
Your computer might tell you not to trust the executable if you download it.
If you don't want to take my word for it, then you just have to recompile the code yourself.
To compile on your device, follow these steps:
* Make sure you have the rust compiler installed on your device.
  Install it here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* In the CLI, cd into the project folder so your working directory is Rust-422-tsiraM
* In the CLI, type "cargo run" and hope for no errors
